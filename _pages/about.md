I am currently working at [Universita della Svizera italiana](https://www.usi.ch/en) as a scientific collaborator. My research focus is on the development of efficient numerical methods for solving optimization problems in the field of partial differential equations, computational mechanics, constrained optimization, and machine learning.

### Research interests:
- Multilevel Methods
- Domain Decomposition Methods
- Unfitted Discretization Methods
- Contact Problems
- Constrained Optimization
- Scientific Machine Learning
