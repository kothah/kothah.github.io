  description: Due to its optimal complexity, the multigrid (MG) method is one of the most popular approaches for solving large-scale linear systems arising from the discretization of partial differential equations. However, the parallel implementation of standard MG methods, which are inherently multiplicative, suffers from increasing communication complexity. In such cases, the additive variants of MG methods provide a good alternative due to their inherently parallel nature, although they exhibit slower convergence. This work combines the additive multigrid method with the multipreconditioned conjugate gradient (MPCG) method. In the proposed approach, the MPCG method employs the corrections from the different levels of the MG hierarchy as separate preconditioned search directions. In this approach, the MPCG method updates the current iterate by using the linear combination of the preconditioned search directions, where the optimal coefficients for the linear combination are computed by exploiting the energy norm minimization of the CG method. The idea behind our approach is to combine the $A$-conjugacy of the search directions of the MPCG method and the quasi $H_1$-orthogonality of the corrections from the MG hierarchy. In the numerical section, we study the performance of the proposed method compared to the standard additive and multiplicative MG methods used as preconditioners for the CG method.

- title: "Enhancing training of physics-informed neural networks using domain-decomposition based preconditioning strategies"
  year: 2023
  type: journal
  label: kopanicakova_2023

  description: We propose to enhance the training of physics-informed neural networks. To this aim, we introduce nonlinear additive and multiplicative preconditioning strategies for the widely used L-BFGS optimizer. The nonlinear preconditioners are constructed by utilizing the Schwarz domain decomposition framework, where the parameters of the network are decomposed in a layerwise manner. Through a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that both additive and multiplicative preconditioners significantly improve the convergence of the standard L-BFGS optimizer while providing more accurate solutions of the underlying PDEs. Moreover, the additive preconditioner is inherently parallel, thus giving rise to a novel approach to model parallelism.

- title: "Nonlinear Schwarz preconditioning for Quasi-Newton methods"

  description: We propose the nonlinear restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioning strategy to improve the convergence speed of limited memory quasi-Newton (QN) methods. We consider both "left-preconditioning" and "right-preconditioning" strategies. As the application of the nonlinear preconditioning changes the standard gradients and Hessians to their preconditioned counterparts, the standard secant pairs cannot be used to approximate the preconditioned Hessians. We discuss how to construct the secant pairs in the preconditioned QN framework. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the preconditioned QN methods using numerical experiments.

  description: We propose a nonlinear additive Schwarz method for solving nonlinear optimization problems with bound constraints. Our method is used as a "right-preconditioner" for solving the first-order optimality system arising within the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) framework using Newton's method. The algorithmic scalability of this preconditioner is enhanced by incorporating a solution-dependent coarse space, which takes into account the restricted constraints from the fine level. By means of numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed preconditioned Newton methods outperform standard active-set methods considered in the literature.
